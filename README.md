# 👋 Hi, I'm Víctor Moreno

I'm from Barcelona, and I'm passionate about both technology and music. I play the flute and trumpet  🎶. I’ve taught flute and music theory to primary school students for four years. At the same time, I balanced my engineering studies with my passion for programming and applied mathematics, focusing especially on computer vision for autonomous driving  🚙.

## Projects

- **CBIR System for PIV**: Implementation of a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System using a Color Structure Descriptor for the PIV course at university.
- **EC-thor (Bachelor Thesis)**: Developed a fast instance segmentation system for sparse and unstructured point clouds using Fast Euclidean Clustering, specifically for detecting cones in the Formula Student context. This project was awarded a perfect score (10/10).

## Experience  🧑‍💻

- Member of **Formula Student BCN eMotorsport** 🏎️, particularly in the Perception department of the Autonomous System. In my second year, I led the department.
- Currently working as a **ROS Developer** at Vaive Logistics, focusing on ONA, a double-Ackermann autonomous delivery robot  📦 with a net payload capacity of 100kg.

## Education  🎓

- **Bachelor's in Telecommunications Technologies and Services Engineering** at the **Escola Tècnica Superior d'Enginyeria de Telecomunicació de Barcelona (ETSETB)**, UPC (2020 - 2024), specializing in audiovisual systems.
